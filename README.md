# GeometricPartitionEntropy
 Code accompanying the paper: Geometric partition entropy: course-graining a continuous state space

histent.m is a basic histogram entropy estimator

qent.m is the basic geometric quantile partition entropy estimator

Each figure in the paper can be recreated using the associated m-file 

Figure 04 B and C involves the use of an altered version of the 
        circularGraph.m m-file and its associated node.m m-file as well
